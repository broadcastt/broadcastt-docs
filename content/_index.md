Broadcastt provides tools to help developers create realtime applications.

Broadcastt has a publish/subscribe model. Systems can subscribe to channels and your system can publish data on channels, which will be sent to the subscribers of that channel.

Private and presence channels are protected so you can publish sensitive information via them.

Presence channels can even show who is online.
