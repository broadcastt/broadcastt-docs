## Authentication

Query params

| body_md5 | For POST requests | This parameter must contain the hexadecimal MD5 hash of the body. |

### Authentication signature

The signature is a HMAC SHA256 hex digest.

The signature is generated by signing a string made up of the following components:

* The request method in uppercase. (example `POST`)
* The request path with leading forward slash. (example `/api/path`)
* The query parameters sorted alphabetically by key. The string must not be URL escaped. (example `a=foo&b=bar&c=foo bar`)

These components then must be concatenated with new line characters `\n`.

Full example

```
POST\n/api/path\na=foo&b=bar&c=foo bar
```
