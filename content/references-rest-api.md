The API hosted at `http://CLUSTER.broadcastt.xyz`, where CLUSTER represents your own apps cluster. The API can be accessed via HTTP or HTTPS. However, we recommend to use HTTPS.

All request described here must be authenticated. Read about it [here](#authentication).

For POST methods [authentication](#authentication) parameters must be query parameters. Request data must be in POST body as a JSON hash.

To indicate the status of the request the following HTTP status codes are in use:

| Code | Description |
| - | - |
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | Bad request. Error details in response body. |
| 401 | Unauthorized. Error details in response body. |
| 403 | Forbidden. Error details in response body. |
| 404 | Not found. |
| 413 | Request Entity Too Large. |

## Authentication

Query params

| auth_version | true | Authentication version. Currently `1.0` |
| body_md5 | For POST requests | This parameter must contain the hexadecimal MD5 hash of the body. |
| auth_signature | true | [Authentication signature](#authentication-signature) |

### Authentication signature

The signature is a HMAC SHA256 hex digest.

The signature is generated by signing a string made up of the following components:

* The request method in uppercase. (example `POST`)
* The request path with leading forward slash. (example `/api/path`)
* The query parameters sorted alphabetically by key. The string must not be URL escaped. (example `a=foo&b=bar&c=foo bar`)

These components then must be concatenated with new line characters `\n`.

Full example

```
POST\n/api/path\na=foo&b=bar&c=foo bar
```
